<h1>THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies!!</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Suspicion : Andhadhun(2018)</h3>   
</p>If someone is searching for something to blindside, blindfold and unsight 
themselves then this might just be just what you've been looking for. Full of right angles, U turns, 
contradictions and deception - occasionally requiring a few hopes of faith to overcome. Some of the slightly incredulous events and scenarios,
they're all forgivable, as the originality and unique nature of the story grabs the attention and signs seals and delivers a climax to work out
and interpret with your own innervisions.</p>

<h3>Science-Fiction : Interstellar(2014)</h3>
<p>This is likely one of my top 5 favourite movies of all time.
     The story was very well-written and is realistic without sacrificing the evocative
     and awe-inspiring nature of the best space/time-travel movies. It is just an overall 
     transcendent experience. One needs to pay attention to every little thing that happens 
     in this film to really understand the plot, straight from the get-go, but its so worth 
     it when realizations are made at the climax. The acting is phenomenal, but that's to be
     expected when you Jessica Chastain and Matthew McConaughey are paired up- their father/daughter
     bond is the heart and soul of this movie. Even as it ends on a hopeful note, there is an 
     underlying sadness throughout the movie (which Hans Zimmer's score brings out beautifully) 
     that really adds to its weighty and monumental feel and keeps the viewers rooting for the main 
     characters. My eyes were glued to the screen the whole time.</p>

 <h3>Romantic Fiction: Sita Ramam(2022)</h3>
 <p>Sita Ramam is just a beautiful story of simple and powerful
     love and yes even if our Sita and Rama don’t get together (physically) at end but stilly emotionally and probably
     in another relam they are and will be together for their love is divine and eternal. No other actors would have
     been this perfect and lovable  for the main cast roles as like Dulquer Salman and Mrunal Thakur .I would praise 
     the director cum writer of the movie Hanu Raghavapudi for taking up issues like India Pakistan and Hindu Muslim 
     so much effectively without causing any distress. The movie hasn’t been a mess at all since the chronology of 
     various events taking place are well arranged, and finally coming to music; I am pleased with Vishal 
     Chandrashekhar for using more of a classical and contemporary way which indeed suits it .</p>
